# PID Control
PID controller to control the steering angle of a self driving car

---

## P - Control
 - A controller with only a P gain oscillates a lot.
 - The amplitude of these oscillations are directly proportional to the gain.
 - Here's a video of the self driving car steering only on P - Control.
